# Venice.ai Images Generater

An unofficial, browser-based image generator that uses the [Venice.ai API](https://venice.ai) to convert text prompts into images. With support for single image generation and batch creation (10 images at a time), this tool runs entirely in your web browserâ€”no backend required.

## Live Demo

## Features

- **Single Image Generation:** Generate an image from a text prompt and view it immediately.
- **Batch Image Generation:** Create 10 images in one go and download them as a ZIP file.
- **API Key Management:** Enter your API key and have it automatically prefixed with `"Bearer "`.
- **Persistent Settings:** Your API key and prompt are saved in your browser's localStorage, so they persist across sessions.
- **No Backend Required:** All processing is done on the client side using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How It Works

This tool sends POST requests directly from your browser to the Venice.ai API. You enter your desired image parameters (prompt, style, dimensions, etc.), and the tool handles the API calls. For batch generation, it packages the images into a ZIP file using JSZip.
